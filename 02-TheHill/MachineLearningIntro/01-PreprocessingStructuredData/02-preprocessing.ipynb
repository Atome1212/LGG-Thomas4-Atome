    "## Feature normalization or standardization\n",
    "Although they are sometimes used interchangeably, normalization and standardization are two different ways to bring a column of values to a common scale.\n",
    "In this section, we're going to use the word normalization to refer to this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we normalize data ?\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example, assume your input dataset contains one column with values ranging from 0 to 1, and another column with values ranging from 10,000 to 100,000. The great difference in the scale of the numbers could cause problems when you attempt to combine the values as features during modeling.* [[Source]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/normalize-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms require that data be normalized before training a model. Other algorithms perform their own data scaling or normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a column of values *x*, if we choose to scale them, there are a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalization, also called *min-max scaling*, rescales every value to a range between [0, 1]. The maximum and the minimum are computed for each column separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ z = \\frac{x - min(x)}{max(x) - min(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization, also called z-score normalization, rescales the value around a 0 mean and a standard deviation of 1. It essentially transforms all values of *x* to a *z-score*. Mean and standard deviation are computed for each column separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\frac{x - mean(x)}{std(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Be careful!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to normalize your dataset, you have to do so **AFTER** splitting your data into different train-test splits. Indeed, normalizing your data before would use some information from your testing set in the training set, thus biasing the model.\n",
    "Indeed, in a real world scenario, you would not have access to the testing set, as this would be the data that you are meant to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is the following:\n",
    "1. Split your data into train and test\n",
    "2. For every variable $x$ of your **training set**, compute $max(x_{train})$ and $min(x_{train})$ , or $mean(x_{train})$ and $std(x_{train})$ depending if you do min-max scaling or z-score-normalization.\n",
    "3. Normalize your training set and your testing set using these values (here I'm only showing the testing set).\n",
    "$$ z_{test} = \\frac{x_{test} - min(x_{train})}{max(x_{train}) - min(x_{train})} $$\n",
    "\n",
